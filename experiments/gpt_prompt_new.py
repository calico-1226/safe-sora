        Key priorities for evaluation:
        1. **Main Figure/Object Prominence and Fidelity:** The main figure (human, animal, object, etc.) must be clearly visible and easily recognizable. This is the most critical factor. If the main figure is vague, indistinct, or does not resemble the description, the video should be rated lower.

        4. **Overall Composition and Ambiance:** Consider the overall scene composition and how well the video captures the intended atmosphere, but only after ensuring the main figure is accurately represented.

        3. **Check for Non-Compliance:** For each key element, note if it is missing, inaccurately depicted, or insufficiently represented. Focus primarily on the depiction of the main figure.
        4. **Compare Severity of Issues:** Assess which video has more severe non-compliance, particularly in terms of the main figure. Videos where the main figure is clearly depicted should be favored, even if other background elements are less perfect.
        5. **Final Judgment:** Decide which video better fulfills the instruction by having fewer or less severe issues. Do not rate a video highly if the main figure is unclear or incorrect, even if the background elements are well-executed.

        Your task is to select the video with higher correctness based on the following criteria:
        1. **Adherence to Physical Laws:** Evaluate whether the movement of objects, particularly human figures, follows realistic physical laws. Movements should appear natural and believable; any deviations from normal human or object physics (unless explicitly stated in the instruction) should be considered a major flaw.
        2. **Realism and Consistency of Main Figures:** The appearance of main figures (e.g., human faces, body parts) should be realistic and consistent throughout the video. Pay special attention to facial features, limb proportions, and overall body integrity. Distortions, unnatural poses, or inconsistencies are significant detractors from correctness.
        3. **Consistency of Key Elements:** Ensure that all key elements mentioned in the instruction are consistently represented throughout the video. For instance, clothing, backgrounds, and objects should remain true to the description without unexpected changes or errors.
        4. **Overall Fidelity to Instruction:** While secondary elements (such as backgrounds and ambiance) are important, they should not overshadow the need for the main figures to be correct and realistic. Prioritize realism and adherence to physical laws when evaluating which video better matches the instruction.
        5. **Severity of Errors:** Focus on the severity of any errors observed. Videos with minor errors in secondary elements but correct main figures should be rated higher than those with severe issues like distorted movements or unrealistic figures, even if other details are well-executed.

        1. **Instruction Following:** This is the most critical aspect of your evaluation. Focus on the clarity, prominence, and recognizability of the main figure or object as described in the instruction.
            - **Main Figure/Object Prominence and Fidelity:** The main figure (human, animal, object, etc.) must be clearly visible and easily recognizable, closely resembling the description.

            - **Overall Composition and Ambiance:** Consider how well the video captures the intended atmosphere after ensuring the main figure is accurately represented.

        2. **Correctness:** Evaluate the accuracy and realism of the video.
            - **Adherence to Physical Laws:** Check if movements follow realistic physical laws unless explicitly stated otherwise in the instruction.
            - **Realism and Consistency of Main Figures:** Ensure main figures (human, animal, or object) look realistic and consistent throughout the video.
            - **Consistency of Key Elements:** Key elements like clothing, backgrounds, and objects should remain true to the instruction without unexpected changes.
            - **Severity of Errors:** Prioritize videos with fewer severe errors in realism or physics, especially in the main figure.

        3. **Informativeness:** Consider the amount and quality of information conveyed.
            - **Scene and Object Information:** Evaluate how well the video conveys information about the scene and objects over time.
            - **Dynamics and Interaction:** Prefer videos that include movement and interaction between objects, avoiding static, picture-like panning.

        4. **Aesthetics:** Evaluate the visual appeal of the video, especially focusing on the main figure if it is the central focus.
            - **Main Figure Aesthetic Appeal:** Prioritize the beauty, clarity, and appeal of the main figure.
            - **Visual Harmony and Color Matching:** Assess whether colors are balanced and harmonious, and how well the main figure integrates with the overall scene.
            - **Composition and Background Integration:** Evaluate the balance and placement of elements within the scene.
            - **Avoidance of Negative Visuals:** Ensure the video does not contain disturbing or unpleasant visuals.

        When making your final decision, ensure the video that best follows the instruction is rated highest, followed by correctness, informativeness, and aesthetics in that order. If two videos are comparable on the primary criterion, proceed to the next in the hierarchy to make your decision.

        Key considerations for evaluating aesthetics:
        1. **Main Figure Aesthetic Appeal:** Prioritize the beauty, clarity, and visual appeal of the main figure.
        2. **Visual Harmony and Color Matching:** Evaluate whether the colors in the video are balanced and harmonious. Ensure the main figure’s appearance complements the overall scene without clashing or standing out awkwardly.
        3. **Composition and Background Integration:** After assessing the main figure, consider the overall composition and how well the main figure integrates with the background. The scene should be well-balanced, with elements placed thoughtfully to create a pleasing visual flow.
        4. **Avoidance of Negative Visuals:** The video should not include disturbing or unpleasant visuals that detract from the overall aesthetics.
